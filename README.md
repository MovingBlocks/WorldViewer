MapViewer
=========

A world-generator based map viewer for Terasology


Overview
-----------

This a 2D map viewer for Terasology world generators. Its main purpose is to preview generated facets for faster and easier debugging.




Limitations
---------------

* It currently works for [PolyWorld](https://github.com/Terasology/PolyWorld) and [Cities](https://github.com/Terasology/Cities) only.

* To some extent, [FacadeAWT](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeAWT) and [Minimap](https://github.com/Terasology/minimap) are similar to this project. 


Open Issues
--------------

* Support Facades properly, so that any world generator can be used

* Merge world rendering into FacadeAWT as far as it makes sense

* Consider relocating this project to the MovingBlocks github organization as it is more of a library than a game module
